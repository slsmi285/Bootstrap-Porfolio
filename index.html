        <p>Sandy's first experience with computer programming language was during her first
          year of college with Basic. It was always an interest of hers to learn programming language further, she enrolled
          in Vanderbilt University's coding bootcamp.<br>
          <br>
          While she resides in Maryville, Tennesee with her husband and children, she is originally
          from Oahu, Hawaii.  Her co-workers dubbed her husband as "Silver Fox", and he willingly accepted the nickname. She has two handsome sons. William
          is her eldest and lives in nearby town. Her youngest is Josh, who is special needs, and has a
          fabulous team of nurses and caregivers that assist Sandy and her husband.<br>
          <br>
          Additionally, Sandy and Silver Fox have two pets that they rescued recently. Buster is a 2 year old Boxer 
          that is as huge as a Bull Mastiff, and Bailey is a 1 year Pit-Shepard mix. Both pets are their muse, 
          as they are very much like children.<br>
          <br>
          Sandy retired from the wedding industry as a professional wedding photographer. Early in her career, she competed for 
          6 years in a row in print competitions. In local she won in all categories, always taking Best of Show. Internationally, 
          she placed two years in Honorable Mentioned in the Premiere Category, where her photos were published in the "Winners Book" for PPA.
          Photography is still a passion, but more so as a hobby. Traveling to Hawaii, painting and gardening are her current
          "time-off" pursuits these days.
